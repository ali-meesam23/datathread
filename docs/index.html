            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p class="lead">At Data Thread Inc., we sit at the intersection of financial markets, data engineering, and heavy industry.</p>
            
            <h3>Our experience spans:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Algorithmic trading & market making across centralized and decentralized exchanges, managing strategy design, execution pipelines, and P&L optimization for multi-hundred-million AUM environments.</li>
                <li>Digital transformation and analytics inside large industrial operations (potash, nitrogen, phosphate), delivering forecasting tools, dashboards, and computer-vision projects that improved throughput, safety, and cashflow predictability.</li>
                <li>Trading systems development for FX, derivatives, and crypto, including REST-based execution platforms, data servers, and real-time analytics for proprietary trading firms.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Our edge is full-stack thinking:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>From business problem → data model & architecture → trading / operational logic → dashboards and workflows.</li>
                <li>Combining engineering discipline (process design, risk, safety) with quant/trading practicality (latency, fees, slippage, margin).</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="highlight">We're not a slideware consultancy. We build models and systems that plug into your existing stack and show up in your P&L, KPIs, and uptime.</p>
